Machine learning techniques are widely applied  to predict the behavior of financial markets. A common problem to all machine learning techniques is the bottomless appetite for data. We plan to solve this problem by synthesizing  trading data, which is close enough to the real data, so that we have more data to train machine learning models on. This project is in association with J.P. Morgan to perform data augmentation for  financial time series data with neural network method. Our goal is to strike an optimal tradeoff between the dissimilarity and explainability of the generated data, as compared to the real one.
